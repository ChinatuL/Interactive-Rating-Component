## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow
-   JavaScript
    -   Arrow Functions
    -   Template Literals

### What I learned

One of the useful properties I learned in this project was how to use the JavaScript **classList** property to add/remove classes to elements.

```js
if (!rateValue) {
    rateAlert.classList.add("show-alert");
}
```
